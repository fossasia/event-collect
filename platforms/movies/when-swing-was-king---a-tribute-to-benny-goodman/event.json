    "description": "Benny Goodman often featured a wonderful small band that could play it hot- really blazing on tunes like Slipped Disc and Airmail Speical- and delicate on lovely numbers like Memories of You. This was a trailblazing group as it was considered the first openly integrated band performing in concerts halls and movies.In this concert Paul Cosentino and the Boilermaker Jazz Band will bring the energy and delicate swing of the small bands to you, performing some of their best known material. You'll also hear some of your favorite Goodman Big Band melodies, done small band style.Jennifer McNulty brings you selections by Benny's Gals, including hits by Peggy Lee, Liltin' Martha Tilton and the Helen's- Ward and Forrest.",
