This full-day workshop gets right to the heart of that issue and shows you how to identify common performance problems using the tools available to you within SQL Server. With the problems identified, we then proceed to figure out how to address those problems using execution plans to understand the choices made by the query optimizer. You\u2019ll learn multiple ways to capture execution plans, how to interpret them, and how to query them directly. All the examples and scripts will be immediately applicable to your systems. You can address your performance problems in order to make your T-SQL code run faster. About Grant Fritchey... Grant is an active participant in the SQL Server Central discussion forums.
